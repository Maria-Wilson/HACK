Project Description

Campus Block Navigation System is a simple web-based interface that displays four campus blocks with their images and structured route points. It provides a clean visual layout for navigation inside a campus and includes a navigation button to move to the next page.

The Problem Statement

Students and visitors often struggle to identify different blocks inside a campus and understand the proper route flow. There is a need for a simple visual navigation system that clearly displays block information and route points.

The Solution

We created a responsive web interface that:

Displays 4 campus block images in a structured grid layout

Lists route points clearly in sequence

Provides a navigation button for moving to the next page

Ensures clean UI and easy understanding
